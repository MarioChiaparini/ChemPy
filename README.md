This project had one goal, predict minerals by yout raman shift data, with some chemical instruments of analysis the model can make a prediction without seeing
the graphs. Beacuse for most of the geologists and chemists analyze the raman graphs it is not that easy, so as chemical enigineering student and a programmer I decide to create a model that could save time of geologist or chemists from mining companies. 
	<br>
	I decide to put five types of minerals:
	<br>
	-Gold

	<br>
	-Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate
	<br>
	-Diamond
	<br>
	-Iron
	<br>
	-Quartz
